# Block Physics

The block physics system handles support requirements and physical behavior of blocks in the world.

## Package Location

`com.hypixel.hytale.builtin.blockphysics.*`

## Support System Overview

Blocks can require support from neighboring blocks and provide support to others. When support requirements aren't met, blocks react according to their `SupportDropType`.

## Support Configuration

```json title="Block with support requirements"
{
  "Id": "MyPlugin_HangingLantern",
  "Support": {
    "Up": [{ "Type": "Full" }]
  },
  "SupportDropType": "DROP"
}
```

This lantern requires full support from above and drops as an item if that support is removed.

## Support Properties

### Support (Required Support)

Defines what support this block needs from neighbors:

```json title="Support requirements"
{
  "Support": {
    "Down": [{ "Type": "Full" }],
    "Up": [{ "Type": "Full" }],
    "North": [{ "Type": "Partial" }],
    "South": [{ "Type": "Partial" }],
    "East": [{ "Type": "Partial" }],
    "West": [{ "Type": "Partial" }]
  }
}
```

| Face | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Down` | Block below |
| `Up` | Block above |
| `North` | Block to the north |
| `South` | Block to the south |
| `East` | Block to the east |
| `West` | Block to the west |

### Supporting (Provided Support)

Defines what support this block provides to neighbors:

```json title="Support provided to neighbors"
{
  "Supporting": {
    "Up": [{ "Type": "Full" }],
    "North": [{ "Type": "Full" }],
    "South": [{ "Type": "Full" }],
    "East": [{ "Type": "Full" }],
    "West": [{ "Type": "Full" }]
  }
}
```

<Aside type="note">
A solid block typically provides `Full` support to all adjacent faces except `Down` (blocks don't support blocks above them by pushing up).
</Aside>

### Support Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Full` | Complete support (solid blocks) |
| `Partial` | Partial support (fences, walls) |
| `None` | No support provided |

## SupportDropType

Determines what happens when a block loses required support:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `BREAK` | Block breaks (destroyed, no drop) |
| `DROP` | Block drops as item |
| `NONE` | Block stays (no physics, floating) |

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="DROP">
```json title="Drops as item"
{
  "Id": "Torch",
  "Support": {
    "Down": [{ "Type": "Full" }]
  },
  "SupportDropType": "DROP"
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="BREAK">
```json title="Breaks on support loss"
{
  "Id": "IceBlock",
  "Support": {
    "Down": [{ "Type": "Full" }]
  },
  "SupportDropType": "BREAK"
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="NONE">
```json title="Floats (no physics)"
{
  "Id": "MagicOrb",
  "SupportDropType": "NONE"
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Support Properties

### MaxSupportDistance

Maximum distance support can travel (for chains, vines, etc.):

```json title="Support distance"
{
  "MaxSupportDistance": 5
}
```

Range: 0-14 blocks. Use for blocks that can hang from a ceiling but only up to a certain length.

### SupportsRequiredFor

When support is validated:

```json title="Support check timing"
{
  "SupportsRequiredFor": "PLACEMENT_AND_EXISTENCE"
}
```

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `PLACEMENT_ONLY` | Only check on placement |
| `EXISTENCE_ONLY` | Only check during world updates |
| `PLACEMENT_AND_EXISTENCE` | Check both times |

### IgnoreSupportWhenPlaced

Bypass support validation on initial placement:

```json title="Ignore support on placement"
{
  "IgnoreSupportWhenPlaced": true
}
```

Useful for decorative blocks placed by world generation.

## BlockFaceSupport

Fine-grained support configuration per face:

```json title="Detailed face support"
{
  "BlockFaceSupport": {
    "Up": {
      "SupportType": "Full",
      "RequiredArea": 0.5
    }
  }
}
```

## Complete Example

```json title="Wall-mounted shelf block"
{
  "Id": "MyPlugin_WallShelf",
  "DrawType": "Model",
  "CustomModel": "models/shelf.blockymodel",
  "Material": "Wood",
  "Support": {
    "North": [{ "Type": "Full" }],
    "South": [{ "Type": "Full" }],
    "East": [{ "Type": "Full" }],
    "West": [{ "Type": "Full" }]
  },
  "Supporting": {
    "Up": [{ "Type": "Partial" }]
  },
  "SupportDropType": "DROP",
  "SupportsRequiredFor": "PLACEMENT_AND_EXISTENCE"
}
```

This shelf:
- Must be placed against a wall (any horizontal direction)
- Provides partial support for items placed on top
- Drops as an item if the wall is removed
