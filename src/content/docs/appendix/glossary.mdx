# Glossary

This glossary defines terms commonly used throughout the Hytale Server Modding documentation.

## A

### Archetype
A specific combination of components that defines an entity type. Entities with the same set of components share the same archetype. Archetypes enable efficient storage and querying.

### Asset
Game content defined in JSON files, such as block types, items, sounds, and particles. Assets are loaded from asset packs and can be modified or extended by plugins.

### AssetMap
A type-safe collection that stores loaded assets, providing methods for lookup by ID or index.

### AssetPack
A collection of asset files bundled with a plugin. Asset packs follow a specific directory structure and are loaded automatically when `IncludesAssetPack` is true in the plugin manifest.

## B

### Blackboard
A shared memory structure used by NPCs for decision making and communication between AI components.

### BlockState
Per-block instance data stored in the ChunkStore for blocks that need persistent state (e.g., chests, doors). Block states are ECS components. **Note:** This class is marked `@Deprecated(forRemoval = true)`.

### BlockType
An asset that defines a block's appearance, behavior, and properties. Block types are loaded from the `blocktype/` directory.

### BuilderCodec
A type of codec that uses a builder pattern for defining serialization. It allows field-by-field specification with optional inheritance.

## C

### Chunk
A 32x320x32 block column in the world (`ChunkUtil.SIZE=32`, `ChunkUtil.HEIGHT=320`). Chunks are the fundamental unit of world loading and saving.

### ChunkStore
The ECS store that manages chunk-level components and data, such as block states.

### Codec
A serialization/deserialization mechanism used throughout Hytale for converting objects to/from BSON or JSON format.

### CommandBuffer
A buffer that collects ECS operations during system execution. Operations are applied atomically after system processing completes.

### Component
A data container attached to entities or chunks in the ECS. Components hold state but no behavior.

### ComponentType
A type descriptor that identifies and provides metadata for a component class.

## E

### ECS (Entity Component System)
The architectural pattern used by Hytale for game objects. Entities are IDs, components are data, and systems are behavior.

### Entity
A unique identifier in the ECS that can have components attached to it. Entities represent all dynamic objects in the game.

### EntityStore
The ECS store that manages entity components. Each world has its own EntityStore.

### Event
A message that signals something happened in the game. Events can be listened to by plugins and may be cancellable.

### EventBus
The central dispatcher that manages event listeners and delivers events to registered handlers.

### EventPriority
The order in which event listeners are called. Priorities range from FIRST (-21844) to LAST (21844).

## F

### Flock
A group of NPCs that coordinate their behavior using flocking algorithms (alignment, separation, cohesion).

## G

### GlobalFilter
A filter applied to all slots in an ItemContainer, controlling what items can be added or removed.

## H

### Holder
A temporary container for components before they're spawned into a Store. Holders are used to construct entities.

### Hotbar
The quick-access inventory row typically displayed at the bottom of the player's screen.

## I

### ICancellable
An interface for events that can be cancelled, preventing their default behavior.

### Interaction
A block or entity behavior triggered by player input. Interactions are defined as assets and executed server-side.

### ItemContainer
An interface for item storage, implemented by various container types like chests and player inventories.

### ItemStack
A stack of one or more items of the same type, with optional metadata and durability.

## J

### JavaPlugin
The base class for Hytale server plugins. All plugins extend this class and override lifecycle methods.

## K

### KeyedCodec
A codec that wraps another codec with a key name, used for fields in serialization.

## L

### LivingEntity
An entity type that has health, can take damage, and can die. Players and NPCs are living entities.

## M

### MotionController
An NPC component that handles movement calculations for different locomotion types (walking, flying, swimming).

## N

### NPC (Non-Player Character)
An AI-controlled entity with a Role that defines its behavior.

## P

### PlayerRef
The primary interface for working with connected players. It bridges network connections with in-world entities.

### Plugin
A server extension that adds or modifies functionality. Plugins are packaged as JAR files with a plugin.json manifest.

### PluginManifest
The metadata file (plugin.json) that describes a plugin, including its name, version, dependencies, and entry point.

### Prefab
A pre-built structure that can be placed in the world during generation or at runtime.

## Q

### Query
A filter that specifies which entities a system processes, based on component composition.

## R

### Ref
A stable reference to an entity or chunk in a Store. Refs remain valid across operations.

### Registry
A type-safe collection for storing registrations of components, systems, or other objects.

### Resource
A singleton-like piece of shared data in an ECS store, such as world time or weather state.

### ResourceType
A type descriptor that identifies and provides metadata for a resource class.

### Role
An NPC behavior configuration that defines AI, stats, and appearance.

## S

### Semver
Semantic versioning format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) used for plugin versions.

### SemverRange
A version constraint that specifies compatible plugin versions.

### SlotFilter
A filter applied to specific slots in an ItemContainer.

### Spawn
The creation and placement of an entity in the world.

### SpawnBeacon
A world entity that triggers NPC spawning based on configured conditions.

### Store
The ECS container that manages entities/chunks and their components for a specific store type.

### System
An ECS processor that operates on entities matching a specific Query. Systems provide behavior.

## T

### TickProcedure
Block behavior executed on random ticks, used for growth, decay, and other time-based effects.

### Transaction
An inventory operation result that describes what happened and what remains.

### Transform
An entity's position and rotation in the world.

### TransformComponent
The ECS component that stores an entity's position and rotation.

## U

### Universe
The top-level container for all worlds and player data. There is one Universe per server.

## W

### Warp
A named teleport destination that players can travel to.

### World
A separate game dimension with its own terrain, entities, and rules. Multiple worlds can exist in a Universe.

### WorldGenProvider
An interface for world generation implementations. Different providers create different terrain types.

## Z

### Zone
A large-scale region in world generation with distinct generation rules and biomes.
