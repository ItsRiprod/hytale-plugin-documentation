Block animations bring interactive blocks to life with movement sequences for doors, chests, and other functional blocks. Animations are created in Blockbench and exported as `.blockyanim` files.

## Asset Location

Block animations are stored in the Common assets:

## Using Animations in Block Definitions

Animations are referenced in the `State.Definitions` section of block types:

### Door Animation Example

```json title="Door State Definitions" {5-6,11-14,18-21}
{
  "BlockType": {
    "State": {
      "Definitions": {
        "OpenDoorIn": {
          "HitboxType": "Door_Open_In",
          "InteractionHitboxType": "Door_Open_In_Interaction",
          "InteractionSoundEventId": "SFX_Door_Crude_Open",
          "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Door/Door_Open_In.blockyanim"
        },
        "OpenDoorOut": {
          "HitboxType": "Door_Open_Out",
          "InteractionHitboxType": "Door_Open_Out_Interaction",
          "InteractionSoundEventId": "SFX_Door_Crude_Open",
          "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Door/Door_Open_Out.blockyanim"
        },
        "CloseDoorIn": {
          "InteractionSoundEventId": "SFX_Door_Crude_Close",
          "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Door/Door_Close_In.blockyanim"
        },
        "CloseDoorOut": {
          "InteractionSoundEventId": "SFX_Door_Crude_Close",
          "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Door/Door_Close_Out.blockyanim"
        },
        "DoorBlocked": {}
      }
    },
    "IsDoor": true,
    "Interactions": {
      "Use": "Door"
    }
  }
}
```

### Container Animation Example

```json title="Chest State Definitions" {4,9-12,13-16}
{
  "BlockType": {
    "State": {
      "Id": "container",
      "Capacity": 18,
      "Definitions": {
        "OpenWindow": {
          "InteractionSoundEventId": "SFX_Chest_Wooden_Open",
          "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Chest/Chest_Open.blockyanim"
        },
        "CloseWindow": {
          "InteractionSoundEventId": "SFX_Chest_Wooden_Close",
          "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Chest/Chest_Close.blockyanim"
        }
      }
    },
    "Interactions": {
      "Primary": "Break_Container",
      "Use": "Open_Container"
    }
  }
}
```

## Animation Properties

### State Definition Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `CustomModelAnimation` | `string` | Path to `.blockyanim` file |
| `InteractionSoundEventId` | `string` | Sound to play during animation |
| `HitboxType` | `string` | Hitbox when in this state |
| `InteractionHitboxType` | `string` | Hitbox for interaction detection |

### Default Animation

For blocks with a default idle animation:

```json
{
  "BlockType": {
    "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Candle/Candle_Burn.blockyanim"
  }
}
```

## Door Animation Variants

Doors support multiple animation directions:

| Animation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Door_Open_In` | Door swings towards player |
| `Door_Open_Out` | Door swings away from player |
| `Door_Close_In` | Close from inward position |
| `Door_Close_Out` | Close from outward position |
| `Door_Open_Slide_In` | Sliding door variant |
| `Door_Open_Slide_Out` | Sliding door variant |

<Aside type="tip">
The door system automatically chooses the appropriate animation based on the player's position relative to the door.
</Aside>

## Creating Custom Animations

### In Blockbench

1. Open or create a Hytale Model project
2. Switch to the Animation tab
3. Create keyframes for bone transformations
4. Export as `.blockyanim`

### Animation Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Format | Hytale-specific `.blockyanim` |
| Bones | Must match model bone hierarchy |
| Keyframes | Position, rotation, scale transforms |
| Duration | Varies by animation type |

### Bone Naming

Animations reference bones in the model:

```
Root
├── Body
│   ├── Lid (for chests)
│   ├── Door_Panel (for doors)
│   └── ...
```

## Looping Animations

For ambient effects like flames, use looping animations:

```json
{
  "BlockType": {
    "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Fire/Fire_Burn.blockyanim",
    "Looping": true
  }
}
```

## State Transitions

Animation playback is triggered by state changes:

```json title="Light Toggle States"
{
  "State": {
    "Definitions": {
      "On": {
        "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Light/Light_On.blockyanim",
        "Light": { "Color": "#ffa", "Radius": 8 }
      },
      "Off": {
        "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Light/Light_Off.blockyanim",
        "Light": null
      }
    }
  },
  "Interactions": {
    "Use": {
      "Interactions": [
        {
          "Type": "ChangeState",
          "Changes": {
            "On": "Off",
            "Off": "On"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## File Format

The `.blockyanim` format is a binary format created by Blockbench's Hytale plugin. Key characteristics:

- Created in Blockbench's Animation tab
- References bone names from the model
- Supports position, rotation, and scale keyframes
- Can be looping or one-shot

## Best Practices

1. **Match bone names** - Animation bones must exactly match model bone names
2. **Keep animations short** - Interactive animations should be snappy
3. **Pair with sounds** - Always include `InteractionSoundEventId`
4. **Update hitboxes** - Change `HitboxType` for open/closed states
5. **Test transitions** - Ensure smooth state changes
